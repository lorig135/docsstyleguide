# User Actions
Following are examples of how to describe how the user interacts with the product. Words with multiple meanings such as close, are marked with an asterisk.
When you use a word with multiple meanings in your writing, decide which meaning of the word you will use, and use that meaning
consistently throughout your writing. For example, if you use the word "clear" as a verb (Ex. Clear your browser cache), then always use clear
as a verb. Do not use it as an adjective. Instead, find a synonym, and use it to avoid confusion. Here is a list of verbs we use to describe user actions and interactions with the product or outside of the product. As this list is long, I'd like your suggestions for which ones we should use.
