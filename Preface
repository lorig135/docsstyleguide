# Preface

This guide provides standards for writing and structuring on-prem and cloud-based ForgeRock product docs. 
The goal of this guide is to foster the ForgeRock voice while accommodating individual styles. Included are recommendations for
grammar, punctuation, capitalization, formatting, writing about the UI, translation, accessibility, marketing, and branding.

## General Rules of Thumb
- If a sentence or paragraph is unclear to one person, it’s probably unclear to others. Rewrite it.
- Always align with the product.
- Consistency is preferable. It's better to be consistently wrong (in terms of style, format) then to use a mix of different styles or formats. 


## Audience Overview
Our readers are technical; they design, code, troubleshoot, and maintain the hardware and software systems for their organizations.
TThe level of detail we provide, the vocabulary we use, as well as the structure and length of sentences need to be appropriate for this audience. You decide how much information to
include.

## What does the ForgeRock voice sound like?

Conversational, as if speaking to a peer:
- Address the user as you.
- Use a peer-to-peer and informal voice: In this article, you learn how IDM reconciles user data between two data stores.

Clear, to avoid potential misunderstandings:
- Write active sentences using strong verbs and present tense. Ex.: Use the noSession query string parameter to authenticate without a session.
- Use precise language. Ex.: Use *includes* instead of *comes with*, and *faster* instead of *more quickly*; *so*, and *because of this*, instead of *therefore*, *hence*, and
*as a result*. 

Succinct, to make the best use of our users' time:
- Write short, concise steps equivalent to one or two actions. Ex: Choose Add Users from the Actions menu.
- Use simple words and basic sentence construction. Ex.: Having such volumes of data in cloud raises many challenges.
Rewrite: Large amounts of data in the cloud creates challenges.
- Limit modifiers and extraneous words. Ex.: The LDAP sample is a bit more sophisticated and perhaps realistic in that you need an actual LDAP server to test with.
Rewrite: Yes: You need an LDAP server to test the LDAP sample. OR: An LDAP server is needed to test the LDAP sample.

Universal, to ensure understanding across cultures:
- Use they/their in place of him/her, and his/hers.
- Use accessibility-friendly terms like activate, browse, choose, enable, enter, interact, navigate, and select.
- Avoid slang, jargon, metaphors, colloquialisms, humor, idioms, and American figures of speech like “ballpark figure,” and “the last straw.”
While these figures of speech are second nature to us, they are not to other cultures, even English-speaking ones. Rewrite without using them.
- Avoid conversion, such as verbing, nouning, and neologisms:
Verbing: I Googled the answer.
Nouning: Please eyeball the code change.
