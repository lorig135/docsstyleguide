# General Writing Guidelines
The goal is to make the complex information simple to understand and easy to follow, so our users can complete their work-related tasks effectively:


Use active voice wherever possible. Active voice drives succinct writing and is easier to translate. Examples:
Passive voice: The setup screen is displayed.
Active voice: The setup screen displays.
Sometimes passive voice is unavoidable. Example: The screen is hidden. 

Use fewer words, as they reduce cognitive load and the wall of text:
Ex.: ForgeRock Identity Platform™ serves as the basis for our simple and comprehensive Identity and Access Management solution.
Rewrite 1: ForgeRock Identity Platform™ is the basis of our simple and comprehensive Identity and Access Management solution.
Rewrite 2: ForgeRock Identity Platform™ is the basis of our IAM solution.

Break down complicated complicated sentences.
Example: The setup screen is displayed.
Rewrite: The setup screen displays.

Check each preposition. Can the sentence be written without them? If yes, then do so.

Eliminate unnecessary words:
Example: If calling the default browser for front-channel communications is not acceptable, enabling persistent cookies for session management could be an option in the authorization server configuration. 
Rewrite 1: If calling the default browser for front-channel communications is not an option, try enabling persistent cookies for session management.

When writing steps, ensure each sentence helps the user complete a task. (user-focused content)
