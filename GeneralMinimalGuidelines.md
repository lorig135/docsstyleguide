# General Writing Guidelines
The goal is to make the complex information simple to understand and easy to follow, so our users can complete their work-related tasks effectively:

* Use active voice wherever possible. Active voice drives succinct writing and is easier to translate. Examples:
    * Passive voice: The startup.sh script enables you to specify the following elements of a running instance.
    * Active voice: The startup.sh script lets you specify the following elements of a running instance.
    * Note that sometimes passive voice is unavoidable.  

* Use fewer words, as they reduce cognitive load and the wall of text:
    * Ex.: After installation steps are complete, it is recommended that the installer ZIP and the created installation folders and files be removed from the server.
    * Rewrite: After installation is finished, remove the installer ZIP and the installation files from the server. 
      
* Break down complicated complicated sentences.

      * Example: The setup screen is displayed.
      * Rewrite: The setup screen displays.

* Check each preposition. Can the sentence be written without them? See https://www.dailywritingtips.com/5-ways-to-reduce-use-of-prepositions/ for tips.

*  Eliminate unnecessary words:
      * Example: If calling the default browser for front-channel communications is not acceptable, enabling persistent cookies for session management could be an option in the authorization server configuration. 
      * Rewrite 1: If calling the default browser for front-channel communications is not an option, try enabling persistent cookies for session management.

* When writing steps, ensure each sentence helps the user complete a task. (user-focused content)
