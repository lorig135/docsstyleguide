Following are updates for our platform name, company name, and product names.

The trademarked ForgeRock® name needs to appear in the title followed by the product name and once in running text (in the Abstract whenever possible). 
These suffice as first references, so you do not need to use the ® in subsequent references.

ForgeRock Identity Platform™ only needs to appear once in the title. You do not need to use the ™ in subsequent references. 
The sections that follow provide detailed instructions for using ForgeRock® + product name, and ForgeRock Identity Platform™.  Note that we do not as of this writing trademark ForgeRock Identity Microservices.

Referencing Product Names: Commercial
Use ForgeRock® Access Management, ForgeRock® Directory Services, ForgeRock® Identity Management, and ForgeRock® Identity Gateway. 

Referencing Older Versions of Product Names
Refer to the older versions as OpenAM, OpenDJ, OpenIDM, OpenIG + version number. 

Using the trademarked ForgeRock® name in product docs

In titles and subtitles

Titles
Use ForgeRock® + Product Name. Ex.: Configuring ForgeRock® Identity Gateway
If you use the full product name in your guide's subtitle, then you do not need to use ForgeRock®.

Subtitles 
Title.: Gateway Guide Core Concepts
Subtitle: ForgeRock Identity Gateway 5
NOTE: you do not need to use ™ if ForgeRock Identity Platform is in the subtitle of your guide

ForgeRock® needs to appear in the title (unless the product is ForgeRock Identity Platform™, then we use that) and once in a guide in running text. 
Once this first instance occurs, subsequent references of ForgeRock or ForgeRock + Product Name do not need the ®. See the next section for guidance on using ® in titles and subtitles. 

Since each of our product guides has an abstract and it is very high up in each guide, we use a sentence like the following in the abstract as the first and required trademarking of the ForgeRock name. Ex.:
Instructions for installing and configuring ForgeRock® Access Management.


Using Acronyms With Product Names
Acronyms only need to be defined once per guide at first occurrence.
ForgeRock Access Management (AM)
ForgeRock Directory Services (DS)
ForgeRock Identity Management (IDM)
ForgeRock Identity Gateway (IG)

As with any acronym, define as follows: Use the full term, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Ex.: ForgeRock Identity Gateway (IG)
Once the acronym is defined, use it in every instance instead of the full term.

Referencing Product Names: Community
We no longer use the product names OpenAM, OpenDJ, and others as part of our commercial platform. Use “OpenAM (or OpenDJ, OpenIDM, OpenIG) Community Edition” when referring to the community versions, where product development work is done prior to solidifying the commercial product.       

Referencing ForgeRock Identity Platform™
The only trademarked product name is ForgeRock Identity Platform™.

The ™ should be included the first time the platform name appears in a guide: ForgeRock Identity Platform™. You do not need to use the ™ for subsequent references. You can refer to ForgeRock Identity Platform as “the platform” after first reference.
Refer to older versions as "older versions of the ForgeRock Identity Platform. " 
DO NOT use ForgeRock® Identity Platform™ as it is incorrect. 
Use this sentence to describe the ForgeRock Identity Platform™:
The ForgeRock Identity Platform™ is the only offering for access management, identity management, user-managed access, directory services, and an identity gateway, designed and built as a single, unified platform. 
Per Marketing, please do not refer to the ForgeRock Identity Platform as the "stack," or the "full stack." Please refer to it as ForgeRock Identity Platform. 

Other Features of the ForgeRock Identity Platform
The Directory Server docs now refer to the directory server as the OpenDJ server when the context is general and might apply to a standalone directory proxy or replication server.
The term "directory server" is used when the server has user data and indexes, or when the discussion is generally about (LDAP) directory servers. Note that distinctions are also made between a ForgeRock DS service and a directory service.

ForgeRock® Common REST
We reference this differently than other products:
First reference: ForgeRock® Common REST
Second reference: Common REST
* Please do not use CREST, per Marketing.*

IMPORTANT: IDM provides a connector called the Scripted CREST Connector. This is not a situation where we would use ForgeRock® Common REST.
